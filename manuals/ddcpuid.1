- Cache information
  - Cache level information
- ACPI features
- Virtualization features
  - Paravirtualization interface features
- Memory features
- Debugging features
- Security features
- Miscellaneous details
  - CPUID Leaves
  - Type

Overrides leaves to 20h, 4000_0020h, and 8000_0020h. Affects feature
scanning and -r.

.IP -r, --table
Print a raw table of CPUID data. The table is Markdown-compatible.

Note: Default, the sub-leaf input (ECX) is cleared.

.IP -s
Provide how many sub-leaves (ECX) to travel. Applies for -r.

.IP -l, --level
